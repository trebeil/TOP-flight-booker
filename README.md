Project briefing:

In this project, you’ll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you’ll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. In this case, we’ll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of available flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers
4. Enter billing information

Step 4 would be done via integration of something like Paypal, via a gem or an SDK or Stripe.
